# Bea-shell
A simple app/web shell component, that provides the basic features for navigation purposes, through basic configuration.

Check out the [demo](https://andersbea.github.io/bea-shell/)!

## Introduction
The idea of the Bea-shell is simply to allow me to reuse the menu I need for any and all web applications that I am working on. By avoiding the use of third party frameworks and packages, we don't add any unneccesary libraries to the project that import it. It supports a basic structure in the shape of a top-and sidemenu. Either one is optional and can be modified to support certain details according to the projects needs. Future iterations will also have a very "plug and play" orientation in regards to adding your own css, or importing the larger standards, such as [Material Design](https://material.io/design/) or [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

So in short, a customizable application menu with a low footprint!
